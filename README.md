# TRNG: True Random Number Generator from Fish Movement

This project implements a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) that derives entropy from the unpredictable movements of fish in live YouTube aquarium streams. It leverages computer vision techniques to detect and track fish, extracting their positional data as a source of randomness.

## Features

- **Live Stream Integration**: Captures video from a curated list of YouTube live aquarium streams.
- **Fish Detection & Tracking**: Utilizes YOLOv8 (or similar object detection models) to identify and track fish within the video feed.
- **Entropy Extraction**: Extracts entropy from the movement patterns and positions of detected fish.
- **Randomness Conditioning**: Conditions the raw entropy to produce high-quality, cryptographically secure random numbers (keys).
- **Randomness Testing**: Integrates statistical tests to evaluate the quality and randomness of the generated keys.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Provides a dashboard displaying the live video feed, entropy pool status, and byte distribution histogram.
- **Dynamic Stream Switching**: Press 'n' in the video window to switch to a new random YouTube live stream.
- **Stream URL Display**: The current YouTube stream URL is displayed directly on the video feed for easy reference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- yt-dlp
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/trng.git
    cd trng
    ```
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Ensure you have the `yolov8n.pt` model file in the project root directory.

### Running the TRNG

To start the TRNG and begin generating random numbers:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

A dashboard window will appear, showing the live aquarium feed, detected fish, entropy collection status, and a histogram of collected bytes.

### Controls

-   **`q`**: Press `q` to quit the application.
-   **`n`**: Press `n` to switch to a new random YouTube live stream.

## Project Structure

-   `src/main.py`: Main entry point for the TRNG application.
